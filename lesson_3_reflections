1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other programmers or making your project in multiple machines.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because some commits may not be functional.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are different parts of a same repositary, each containing one or several commits. Clones are a way to copy an entire repository. Fork is the way to clone a repository from another GitHub user into your own GitHub account.
