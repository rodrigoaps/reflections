1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are collaborating with other programmers or making your project in multiple machines.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because some commits may not be functional.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are different parts of a same repositary, each containing one or several commits. Clones are a way to copy an entire repository. Fork is the way to clone a repository from another GitHub user into your own GitHub account.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can continue improving your code while on the forest.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use Google Drive or a similar service to share the code files. It wouldn't require as much knowlodge of the Git platform, but using GitHub would probalbly be better once everyone involved is up and running.

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes directly on the Master branch i simpler, but making them in separate branches allows for pull requests, wich may be desirable when working in group projects.
